/* 
Consider an infinite full binary tree (each node has two children except the leaf nodes) defined as follows. For a node labelled v its left child will be labelled 2*v and its right child will be labelled 2*v+1. The root is labelled as 1. You are given N queries of the form i j. For each query, you have to print the length of the shortest path between node labelled i and node labelled j.
