 Being in love with number theory, Johnny decided to take a number theory course. On the first day, he was challenged by his teacher with the following problem: given a number N, compute the product of its positive divisors. Johnny is desperate to impress his new teacher so he asks you for help. In this problem, the divisors of N do not include the number N itself. For example, if N=12, the divisors of N (excluding N) are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Thus, the product of divisors is 1x2x3x4x6=144. Since the result may be very large, if the result has more than 4 decimal digits, Johnny only needs to compute the last 4 digits of it.
